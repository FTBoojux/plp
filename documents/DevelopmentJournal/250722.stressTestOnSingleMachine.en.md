# execute simple stress test on the single-thread while loop server

### environment：
cpu： Intel(R) Core(TM) Ultra 7 155H   1.40 GHz
memory： 32.0 GB (31.6 GB 可用)
os： Windows 11 专业工作站版（版本号：26100.3476）
JDK： Oracle OpenJDK 23.0.2

### the registered route for testing

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        WebClient.build()
                .bind(8000)
                .addHandler(new HealthCheckHandler())
                .addHandler(new QuestionParamHandler())
                .addHandler(new PathVariableHandler())
                .listen();
    }
}
```

### test process
- send 100 pre-request to warm up
- gradually increase the frequency of requests
- up to 100(100 request per thread, the quantity of threads is a half the cpu's core)
- test the static path and dynamic path individually
- recode the performance when reach the threshold of the test environment

## stress test before introducing thread pool

### static path's result

while the quantity of request per thread is 70, reach the threshold of test environment, the highest rps(request per second) is about 7,000, the max average respond time is about 5ms

## summarize
by introducing thread pool, the rps increases from about 4000 to 7000, the max average respond time decreases from 8~10ms to 5ms.
