# 对现有的单线程while循环服务器进行了简单的单机压力测试

### 测试环境：
处理器： Intel(R) Core(TM) Ultra 7 155H   1.40 GHz
内存： 32.0 GB (31.6 GB 可用)
操作系统： Windows 11 专业工作站版（版本号：26100.3476）
JDK 版本： Oracle OpenJDK 23.0.2

### 测试用注册路由

```java
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        WebClient.build()
                .bind(8000)
                .addHandler(new HealthCheckHandler())
                .addHandler(new QuestionParamHandler())
                .addHandler(new PathVariableHandler())
                .listen();
    }
}
```

### 测试流程
- 通过预先发送100个请求对系统进行预热
- 后逐步提升请求的频率
- 至高提升到60（每个线程生成60个，线程数去cpu核数的一半）
- 对静态路径和动态路径分别进行测试

## 未引入线程池前压力测试

### 静态路径测试结果

### 引入线程池

```java
    public void listen() throws IOException {
        while(true){
            Socket accept = socket.accept();
            // 从while循环中处理改为交由线程池处理
            threadPool.execute(()->{
                try {
                    handleRequest(accept);

    }

每个线程生成请求数为70左右时，测试环境解决阈值，最高rps约为7000左右，有效测试中最大平均响应时间约为5ms，每个线程生成请求数为80时， 超出系统阈值是的响应时间大幅增加。

## 总结
线程池的引入，使得web client的最高rps从4000左右提升到7000左右，最大平均响应时间从8~10ms降低到5ms左右。
