# 针对Rust版本HTTP服务器进行优化

## 优化事项

### 阻塞接收
原先的 `tcp_listener.accept()` 是一个阻塞的方法：
```Rust
    loop {
        let input = self.tcp_listener.accept();
        match input {
            Ok((mut _socket,addr)) => {
                println!("New connection from: {}", addr);
                self.handle_connection(_socket);
            }
            Err(e) => {
                println!("Error: {}", e);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
```
在官方文档中描述如下：
```text
1.0.0 · Source
pub fn accept(&self) -> Result<(TcpStream, SocketAddr)>
Accept a new incoming connection from this listener.

This function will block the calling thread until a new TCP connection is established. When established, the corresponding TcpStream and the remote peer’s address will be returned.
```

### 零延迟
通过set_nodelay()将tcp连接设置为0延迟

## 改进

### 阻塞接收

将阻塞的tcp_listener.accept()替换为非阻塞的tcp_listener().accept();

### 零延迟

使用Socket2代替TcpListener进行创建，以便进行更精细的参数设置，并将backlog设置为200；
在接收TcpStream时将nodelay设置为true

## 优化后测试表现

优化后进行压力测试，通过cargo run --release启动，通过相同的压力测试程序进行请求模拟。结果如下：
